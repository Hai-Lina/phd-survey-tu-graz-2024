# phd-survey-tu-graz-2024
Survey among PhD students of TU Graz led by the student union (PhD Union) in Oct-Dec 2024.

### Repository set up
The repository mainly comprises four parts:
- `PhD-survey-final-design.pdf` contains the final survey set up (questions, answer alternatives, order of questions).
- `PhD-survey-2024-final-report-021025.pdf` contains the final survey report.
- `PhD-survey-one-pager-021025.pdf` contains a high level summary of the most important findings of the survey.
- Jupyter notebooks `0_` to `6_` contain code to analyze the six modules of the survey.
- Folder `figures` stores the output of these jupyter notebooks.
- File `mock-data.csv` is a tabular file with randomly generated data to run the code. **Important note**: This data is not the original data and does not reproduce the results. See also our data protection regulations.

### Requirements to run
The code runs with some basic Pyhton modules:
- `os`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `geopandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pingouin`

### Data protection
The raw data is only accessible by the head of the PhD Union and the current member responsible for the survey. To protect the privacy of our student body, we do not share the data neither raw nor in an anonymized form.
